Abusedesk plugin for Yourls - URL Shortener

Copyright (c) 2010, Florian Overkamp <florian@tty.nu>

Abusedesk for Yourls is a plugin module written and tested with Yourls SVN rev. 503
but is probably functional with any release of 1.4 or higher.

Abusedesk is designed to allow YOURLS-administrators to prevent or restrict abuse by
link-posters. It does this by the following methods:

1) Implement a blacklist and a report-page. If any visitor states a short URL is abusive, 
the system will automatically mark the URL as 'bad' and report future visitors of this.

2) Implement a banlist and allow the administrator to prevent certain IP-addresses to
post, or prevent certain (partial) URL's to be shortened.

3) If Google Safe Browsing is activated, prevent visitors from running into phishing or
malware sites
